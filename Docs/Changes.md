# Changes

## Milestone 2 / SDK v0.7

### Misc

* AferoSwiftSDK now builds and tests, and AferoLab runs, on XCode9Î²5.
* AferoLab now supports manual association id entry when running in the sim.
* DeviceCollection now automatically starts and stops automatically based
  upon app state.
* DeviceCollection now fetches all app and profile state directly from the ClientAPI
  on startup, improving startup time.
* An off-by-one has been corrected in OTA progress calculation.
* 0.7.2 / IOS-1440: Added an `appId` field to body sent to `/v1/accounts/.../mobileDevices`.

### API Changes

#### Device association/Disassociation have moved

Device association and disassociation have been moved to the DeviceCollection, improving
association time and handling additional configuration tasks automatically.

**Device association** has been moved to:

```swift
DeviceCollection.addDevice(
    with associationId: String,
    location: CLLocation? = nil,
    isOwnershipChangeVerified: Bool = false,
    timeZone: TimeZone = TimeZone.current,
    timeZoneIsUserOverride: Bool = false
) -> Promise<DeviceModel>
```
When using this call, the following happens automatically:
* The device, with profile, is added to the deviceCollection immediately upon
  clientApi return.
* The device's timeZone is set either to a custom-specified value, or the current
  timeZone of the mobile device being used.

**Device Disassociation** has been moved to:

```swift
DeviceCollection.removeDevice(with deviceId: String) -> Promise<String>
```

The returned promise resolves to the `id` of the device removed.

### XCode 9

The short story: make sure you do a `pod update` anytime you switch between XCode 8
and XCode 9.

Longer: While the code is still technically Swift 3.2, and XCode 9 supports
Swift 3.2, there is still some third-party issues which require pointing to
specific branches for beta compatibility.

`Examples/Podfile` has been updated
to select the correct pods based upon the currently-selected XCode version, so
after running `xcode-select -s`, or changing the toolchain location in XCode preferences,
it's important to run `pod update`.

 ## Milestone 1 / SDK v0.6.0

Afero SDK M1 contains a number of changes since the original drop of code to Kenmore, notably:

* All SDK code is now hosted via CocoaPods (currently in the [aferodeveloper] restricted-access repo)
* Conclave 2.0 is included, streamlining device state synchronization with the Afero cloud,
and reducing the number of message types SDK users are required to handle.
* Simplified Softhub integration, using the `AferoSofthub` module.
* The public interface footprint has been reduced, and alignment with
Android Afero SDK API symbol names has been improved.

### CocoaPods Integration

The Afero Swift SDK is now available via the [aferodeveloper] Github account.
This is a restricted-access repository; contact Afero for access.

#### Example Podfile

```ruby

# While in restricted release, the preferred means of access
# is ssh.
source 'git@github.com:aferodeveloper/Podspecs.git'

# If using https, you'll have to authenticate to GitHub
# on every install.
#source 'https://github.com/aferodeveloper/Podspecs.git'

# Include the CocoaPods global spec repo.
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

platform :ios, '9.3'

use_frameworks!

# As of AferoSwiftSDKv1.1.0, 'afero-thirdparty' cannot be included as an
# implicit prerequesite by AferoSwiftSDK, but is a requirement for linking.
# Therefore it must be included in your Podfile.
pod 'afero-thirdparty', '0.0.5'

# Hubby is included implicitly, but warnings can be inhibited like so:
pod 'Hubby', :inhibit_warnings => true

# Finally, include AferoSwiftSDK.
pod 'AferoSwiftSDK', '~> 1.1'

```

### Conclave 2.0

The `DeviceCollection` has been updated to support the Conclave 2.0 protocol. Along
with this change, the set of messages emitted by `DeviceCollection` has been simplified.

### AferoSofthub

The former `AferoHubbyService` and `Hubby` modules have been combined into `AferoSofthub`.
The `AferoSofthub` API has been simplified. In the process, a number of symbols have
been renamed.

For an example of use, see [`AferoSofthubMinder.swift`][afero-softhub-minder] in the `AferoLab` example.

### API changes

#### Renamed Symbols

* `DeviceCollection.deviceForDeviceid(_:)` has been renamed to `DeviceCollection.peripheral(for:)`
