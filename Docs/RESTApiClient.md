# Afero REST API Client

Interaction with the Afero Cloud and Afero Devices involves two network touchpoints:

* The `DeviceEventStream` for realtime updates to connected device state, and
* The REST api for OAuth2 authentication, account creation and management,
  peripheral device management, and more.

This document describes functionality available via the Afero REST Client API,
as well as features available to developers to ease implementation.

# Implementation Options

The Afero SDK provides a few options for implementation of a REST api:

1. Developers can choose a readymade solution based upon `AFNetworking 3.1`
   that provides an implementation for OAuth2 authentication and refresh.
2. Developers who already have an HTTP client or do not wish to use `AFNetworking`
   may integrate with their preferred client by implementing a simple protocol,
   `AferoAPIClientProto`. Doing so provides all the benefits of (1), but Developers
   are required to implement their own OAuth authentication, refresh, and token
   storage logic.

> **NOTE**
>
> While it is possible to write an API Client from scratch that does not conform to
> `AferoAPIClientProto`, there are APIs in the SDK which require a class with
> such conformance.

## Using the AFNetworking-based Client

To use the `AFNetworking` client provided in the SDK, developers simply have
to to reference the appropriate subspec in their `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'AferoSwiftSDK/AFNetworking'    
```

This will automatically pull in in the core `AferoSwiftSDK` code, so no other
subspec references are required.

## Integrating With an Existing Client

If you have an existing HTTP client library you would like to use, the core
`AferoSwiftSDK` implementation vends a protocol, [`AferoAPIClientProto`][AferoAPIClientProto], conformance
to which you can add to your client. Doing so will provide the same rich set of
methods for interacting with the Afero Cloud as is available in the `AFNetworking`-based
client.

To include the SDK in your project without importing the provided `AFNetworking`-based
client, simply reference the main pod in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'AferoSwiftSDK'
```

# OAuth2 Authentication and Refresh

The Afero Cloud uses OAuth2 for authentication. All provided API calls attempt
to refresh tokens OAuth2 credentials prior to failing, whenever a call fails
due to a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response from the Afero cloud. Refresh logic
is delegated to the individual client implementation.

## Authentication

The provided [`AFNetworkingAferoAPIClient`](#appendix-1-afnetworkingaferoapiclient)
provides the following methods related to authentication:

* `signIn(username: String, password: String, scope: String = default) -> Promise<Void>`
* `signOut(_ error: Error? = default) -> Promise<Void>`

See [Appendix 1: AFNetworkingAferoAPIClient](#appendix-1-afnetworkingaferoapiclient) for details.

## Refresh

The provided [`AFNetworkingAferoAPIClient`](#appendix-1-afnetworkingaferoapiclient)
provides refresh and automatic sign-out logic automatically.

When implementing `AferoAPIClientProto` on an existing class, two methods are of
interest:

```swift
    /// Refresh the OAuth2 credential.
    /// - parameter passthroughError: An error, if any, to pass through to the
    ///                               `failure` closure upon unsuccessful refresh.
    /// - parameter success: The closure to execute upon success.
    /// - parameter failure: The closure to execute upon failure.
    /// - note: Implementors should pass `passthroughError`, if any, on to the `failure`
    ///         closure. If `passthroughError` is not provided, then the implementor
    ///         should forward its internal error.
    func doRefreshOAuth(passthroughError: Error?, success: @escaping ()->Void, failure: @escaping (Error)->Void)

    /// Perform signout. This should communicate signed-out status to all
    /// interested parties.
    /// - parameter error: The error, if any, that caused signout.
    func doSignOut(error: Error?, completion: @escaping ()->Void)
```    

`doRefreshOAuth(_:_:_:)` is called whenever a `401` is received as a response from the
Afero cloud. It is expected that implementors will perform refresh and persist
their new credentials in a threadsafe manner prior to calling `success()`.

`doSignOut(_:_:)` is called automatically when `doRefreshOAuthOauth(_:_:_:)` fails.
This is your client's chance to purge existing OAuth2 credentials and signal the
rest of your app that it is no longer signed in.

See [Appendix 2: AferoAPIClientProto](#appendix-2-aferoapiclientproto) for details.

# AferoAPIClientProto Extensions

Through extentions to `AferoAPIClientProto`, a rich set of high-level methods is
exposed for interacting with the Afero Cloud Client API. These calls
return [Promises][PromiseKit][^1] which resolve to their results. For more information
regarding [Promises][PromiseKit], see https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit.

# Account Creation and Management

## Create an Account

```swift
/// Create an account.
/// - parameter credentialID: The user ID (i.e. email)
/// - parameter password: The user's password
/// - parameter firstName: User firstname
/// - parameter lastName: User lastname
/// - parameter credentialType: The type of credential to use; defaults to "email"
/// - parameter verified: Whether or not the account should be created with a

public func createAccount(_ credentialId: String, password: String, firstName: String, lastName: String, credentialType: String = default, verified: Bool = default, accountType: String = default, accountDescription: String = default) -> Promise<Any?>
```

> **NOTE**

/// - parameter accountId: The id of the account being modified
/// - parameter description: The new description of the account
public func setAccountDescription(_ accountId: String, description: String) -> Promise<Void>
```

```swift
/// Request a password reset for the given `credentialId` (email).
/// An email with password reset instructions will be sent to the
/// provided email.
///
/// - parameter credentialId: The email address associated with the account.
/// - returns: A `Promise<Void>` indicating success or failure.
public func resetPassword(_ credentialId: String) -> Promise<Void>
```

## Fetch Account Info

```swift
/// Fetch a users's account info.
public func fetchAccountInfo() -> Promise<UserAccount.User>
```

## Update mobile device info

```
## Disassociate mobile device info

```swift
/// Clear the service's record of this device's association with the given user.
///
/// - parameter userId: The `userId` (NOT `accountId`) for the disassociation.
/// - parameter mobileDeviceId: The app-generated `UUID` for this device.
/// - warning: This will include nuking the association between this device
///             and its APNS token on the service, among other things.

public func disassociateMobileDeviceData(userId: String, mobileDeviceId: String, attemptOAuthRefresh: Bool = default) -> Promise<Void>
```

# Appendix 1: `AFNetworkingAferoAPIClient`

`AFNetworkingAferoAPIClient` provides a default implementation of `AferoAPIClientProto`.


```swift

public AFNetworkingAferoAPIClient: AferoAPIClientProto {

    static public let shared: AFNetworkingAferoAPIClient

    /// Attempt to obtain a valid OAUTH2 token from the service.
    /// - parameter username: The "username" (currently email address) to use to
    ///                       authenticate to the service.
    /// - parameter password: The password to use for authentication
    /// - parameter scope: Should always be `account` (the default)
    /// - returns: A Promise<Void> which fulfills once the OAUTH2 token has been
    ///            successfully retrieved and stored,
    ///            and rejects on any failure.
    public func signIn(username: String, password: String, scope: String = default) -> Promise<Void>
